# traffic-monitoring
Traffic monitoring from video using python and opencv

Mostly based on thesis of Jacub Sochor that you can read in [Here](https://medusa.fit.vutbr.cz/traffic/data/papers/2014-JakubSochor-Thesis.pdf).

## Data
I use sample of [BrnoCompSpeed](https://medusa.fit.vutbr.cz/traffic/research-topics/traffic-camera-calibration/brnocompspeed/) dataset of session 1. They already included the calibration result that I used in here.

## TO-DO
- [ ] download data
- [ ] resampling so each view start at same time
- [ ] background subtraction
- [ ] load VP
- [ ] automatically find common plane
- [ ] perspective inverse mapping
- [ ] combine multicamera
- [ ] draw bounding box
